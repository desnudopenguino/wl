.TH wl 1
.SH NAME
wl \- Work Logger. Allows for easy management of time tracking based on tmux sessions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wl
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B wl
is a set of ksh functions to easily manage a timesheet in terminal.
It is set up to run inside tmux sessions, and tracks the time in a file of the name of the tmux session inside the
.I ~/work_logs/
directory.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-a\fR
Archive the current time sheet and remove all excess sheets locally and remotely (currently works with box's webdav with cadaver and expect installed).
.TP
.BR \-c\fR
Print current time block (last start in file to current time).
.TP
.BR \-d\fR " "[\fImm/dd/yy(date)\fR]
Print the date and total time for a date. Prints today's stats if no date is included.
.TP
.BR \-f\fR " "[\fI"comment"\fR]
End the current row in the time sheet with the current time (rounded to 15 minutes). If a comment is added, append that as well.
.TP
.BR \-g\fR " "[\fIremote_file\fR]
Gets the file from the remote source (currently configured to Box). If remote_file is included, gets that, and not the automated file.
.TP
.BR \-i\fR " "\fIlog_id\fR
Print the full comment for a specific log entry.
.TP
.BR \-N " "[\fIfile_name\fR]
Create a new log file. Including the [old file] will concatenate the old file to the new one.
.TP
.BR \-p\fR
Puts the current log file to the remote source (currently configured to Box).
.TP
.BR \-s\fR
Start a new row in the time sheet with the current date and time (rounded to 15 minutes).
.TP
.BR \-t\fR " "[\fIfile_name\fR]
Print the current log (same action as wl without args), or file_name's log if it is entered.
.TP
.BR \-v\fR
Edit the current work log in vi(m). Make sure to set noeol and binary when working with a current row open, or it will write the file with an EOL character, which will move the next finish input to the next row, making things ugly
.TP
.SH TODO
.BR wl.conf
contains any specific settings needed to customize the interaction for wl.
This encompasses remote backup/saving, directory location, etc... It hasn't been set up yet, but is on the to do list
